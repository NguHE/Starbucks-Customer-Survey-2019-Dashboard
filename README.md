### Scene 1 - Customer Kaleidoscope
- In Scene 1, we enter the fascinating realm of the "Customer Kaleidoscope." Our survey reveals a diverse customer base. Interestingly, most customers spend less than RM20, and over half have an income below RM25k.
- What's intriguing is that we've uncovered a subtle yet significant correlation: as income rises, so does spending behaviour. Additionally, coffee reigns supreme as the preferred beverage among our respondents.

- Now, let's take a closer look at how gender influences these dynamics.
- Females generally exhibit lower spending behaviour, likely attributed to their comparatively lower income levels. However, coffee remains their top choice.
- On the other hand, males tend to spend more, and their higher income can be attributed to a larger proportion of self-employed individuals and fewer students and housewives among them.

### Scene 2 - Working Wonders
- Transitioning to Scene 2, we delve into Consumption Habits influenced by occupation.
- Most customers spend less than 30 minutes at Starbucks and infrequently visit. Their preferred choices are take-away followed by dine-in.

- For students, the majority fall within the 20-29 age range, with some below 20. Their lower income levels correspond to reduced spending. They also visit Starbucks less frequently and spend under 30 minutes during their visits, favouring take-away and dine-in options with expenditures below RM20.

- Housewives also favour take-away and the drive-thru, with limited visitation and duration.
![Screenshot 2023-12-08 181146](https://github.com/NguHE/Starbucks-Customer-Survey-2019-Dashboard/assets/125574265/ffed451d-254b-42b1-ac24-f7e0f2ff4e51)

- Employed customers, mainly aged 20-29, spend more time on their Starbucks visits. Their frequency of visits increases as well.

![Screenshot 2023-12-08 181153](https://github.com/NguHE/Starbucks-Customer-Survey-2019-Dashboard/assets/125574265/ec873ba7-efd2-44ec-8d00-8610c1d551f0)

- Self-employed customers, notably older, spend the most time and visit Starbucks frequently.
- They exhibit consistent weekly and monthly buying patterns, with spending ranging from RM20-40 during dine-ins and over RM40 for drive-thru orders.
- When they dine in, they spend more ( which can be shown in large size of icon for dine in column)

- When we compare it between genders, male tend to have higher visitation, time spent (which can be shown in darker colour in pie chart) and spending habits which shows it is a potential customer group to boost Starbuck growth.

### Scene 3 - Loyalty Brew Happiness
- In Scene 3, we shift our focus to "Satisfaction Ratings" and their impact on customer loyalty. Here, we observe that members tend to have higher satisfaction ratings than non-members.
  
![Screenshot 2023-12-08 181235](https://github.com/NguHE/Starbucks-Customer-Survey-2019-Dashboard/assets/125574265/cbe0c4a4-0c85-42f5-b2aa-23f2ea3eeeac)

- Students, mainly non-members, express the lowest satisfaction with price ranges, leading to a 67% likelihood of continued buying. For those who discontinue buying, place preference and price range, along with concerns about WiFi quality, emerge as key factors.

![Screenshot 2023-12-08 181242](https://github.com/NguHE/Starbucks-Customer-Survey-2019-Dashboard/assets/125574265/e01b7d36-f645-4e8b-894f-ce671930185e)

- Housewives, similar to students, exhibit concerns about the price range.

![Screenshot 2023-12-08 181249](https://github.com/NguHE/Starbucks-Customer-Survey-2019-Dashboard/assets/125574265/4d8152ab-92bb-4662-850b-369206950b22)

- Again, the price range highlighted by Employed customers, mainly non-members, affects their likelihood of continuing to purchase. 

![Screenshot 2023-12-08 181257](https://github.com/NguHE/Starbucks-Customer-Survey-2019-Dashboard/assets/125574265/3426afe8-a0db-4423-8735-e0efab42cdf6)

- Self-employed customers, while generally satisfied, rate WiFi quality the lowest among the factors.

![Screenshot 2023-12-08 181303](https://github.com/NguHE/Starbucks-Customer-Survey-2019-Dashboard/assets/125574265/289e464c-a785-4763-9b79-73bd07def5ab)

### Scene 4 - The Price Dilemma
- From dissatisfaction with price range, we transition to Scene 4, exploring how Price Range & Spending affect customer behaviour.
- The data reveals a compelling correlation: when customers spend less, their satisfaction drops, resulting in lower sales and reduced price range satisfaction.
  
![Screenshot 2023-12-08 181310](https://github.com/NguHE/Starbucks-Customer-Survey-2019-Dashboard/assets/125574265/fda99b07-49ef-4058-93dc-33e5a3b8070b)

- When we filter the spending behaviour, we can see that the satisfaction as well as continued buying and membership is increasing.
- As spending increases, satisfaction rises, signifying that customers perceive their expenses as worthwhile, ultimately driving continued purchasing.
- We also recognize the pivotal role of sales promotions in influencing purchasing decisions across all customer segments.

### Scene 5 - Brewing Buzz
- Our journey concludes in Scene 5, where we uncover the influence of promotional efforts on customer awareness.
- A radial chart illustrates that 73% of customers are reached through social media channels, followed by word-of-mouth and the Starbucks website.

### Findings and Recommendations
- To summarise the findings, most of the customers have lower income, low spending habits, low visitation and low time spending. They prefer coffee and take away.
- We also discover that self-employed individuals can significantly boost sales. They tend to visit Starbucks often, particularly for dining-in allows increasing in spending. Therefore, targeting them for membership could be a strategic approach.
- In findings, we discover that most of the purchasing decisions are affected by promotion sales. Hence, we come out with strategies to have special offers or happy hour promotions.
- For satisfaction rating, price range and wifi quality are concerned. Hence, we come out with the strategies of value menu to provide smaller-size coffee and wifi quality enhancement to create an environment for remote work or study.
- The third findings is membership conversion opportunity which allows customer loyalty and retention. They can enjoy members' rewards such as free coffee by earning star points or free cake during birthday month. This could be done through various platforms with focus on social media as it is the most effective way of promoting.
- The fourth one is word of mouth. It shapes customer spending habits. This comes with the strategy to have referral programs or showcase customer testimonials.
- In future recommendation, it is advised to collect more data so that segmentation or clustering analysis can be done. We can also analyse the market basket to give some combo promotions.
